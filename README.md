## Installation Method:
01. Download the TAR file from my github releases.
02. Install [Samsung USB Drivers and ODIN](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rXszF_ylzWuPnOiiRLAQk_R_APA1lpuA/view?usp=sharing).
03. Put the device to the download mode and flash the downloaded tar via Odin's AP Block. <hr>
## Notes: 
01. If the device is bootlooping, you should perform a factory reset.
02. Stock recovery will broke after installing this ramdisk patch, so use the TWRP kindly.
